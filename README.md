## 🔎 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze F1 data using Excel. I used two powerful Excel tools to do this: Power Query and Power Pivot. 

## 📂 Data Overview

There are 14 different data files, including circuits, constructors, drivers, races, etc.

**Data Cleanup:** Before the analysis, I cleaned the data in Power Query: necessary data types changes were made, some values were replaced, some rows containing errors and unnecessary columns were removed.
